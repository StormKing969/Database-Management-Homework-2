Load scripts
dbbook.sh: Load sample tables into Oracle, on host pe07.cs.umb.edu

Requires that sqlplus is available at the command line
Usage: sh dbbook.sh

See oracle.script for a typescript of a load, after dropping
a previous load. Similarly mysql.script.

Load script for mysql

dbbook_mysql.sh: Load sample tables into mysql, on host pe07.cs.umb.edu.
  First, make a 4-line file .my.cnf in your login directory with your
  mysql password, like this, with xxxx replaced by your password 
  and yyyy by your mysql database name.  
[client]
password=xxxx
[mysql]
database=yyyy

This way, you can use "mysql -u username" to login to your database,
without entering a password, and can load the database without multiple 
password inputs. The .my.cnf file should be protected: "chmod og-r .my.cnf"

Note: The mysql user needs FILE privilege to execute the "load data infile"
mysql command, and the file needs to be under /var/local/cs634, which has
been configured as OK for mysql to access in AppArmor (Ubuntu's
file security daemon).  Your mysql account has FILE privilege.

Usage: sh dbbook_mysql.sh

Scripts used by top-level scripts described above:

load_mysql.sh: use the mysql bulk load command to load a csv 
(comma-separated-value) file with optionally quoted strings 
("foo" instead of foo for a column value).

load_sailors.sh: Like load_mysql.sh, but additionally arranges
that nullstring rating values in the data file turn into
null values in the table.

load_reserves.sh: Like load_mysql.sh, but specifies to mysql
how to interpret 10/10/1996, etc., as a DATE.

Note: table "class" has a row that has null values. For
this table, an insert is used from dbbook.sh and dbbook_mysql.sh,
showing another way to get nulls in place, portably. But note that
this method is useful only when such rows are rare, since inserts are
more costly than row bulk loads.
