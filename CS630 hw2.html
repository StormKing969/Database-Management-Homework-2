    <h3>CS630 Homework 2&nbsp; Getting started with mysql, foreign keys<b>, SQL
        (with subqueries, group by, having)</b><span style="font-style: italic;"><b><em><em></em></em></b></span></h3>
    <p>due <span style="background: yellow">Tuesday, Oct. 9 </span> by midnight in your cs630/hw2 directory.
      Note that Monday, Oct. 8 is a holiday.</p>
    <p>1.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Getting started with mysql:</span></p>
    <p> a. Check your mysql account by simply logging into it. For user joe,
      login to pe07 from users or topcat and do the command:<br>
      <code>mysql -u joe -D joedb -p<br>
        Password: joe</code></p>
    <p>Or if you don't use -D joedb on the command line, use "use joedb" once
      inside mysql. Use "show tables" to look for tables. Unless you used this
      account for other classes, you should see an empty set of tables. If you
      do see old tables and want me to reinitialize your account, let me know by
      email.</p>
    <p>You already have copied the $cs630/tables directory to your own
      ~/cs630/tables directory as directed in homework 1. Again cd to
      cs630/tables and use "ls" to list the files (while logged in on either
      system). You should see dbbook_mysql.sh. In order to load tables with bulk
      load (rather than individual inserts, a slower process), we need to set up
      easy no-password access to mysql, as described in the comments in
      dbbook_mysql.sh, and also in README. For example, user joe creates file
      .my.cnf in his login directory with contents:<br>
      <code>[client]<br>
        password=joe<br>
        [mysql]<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
          database=joedb</span></code> </p>
    <p>Since this lists your password, it should be protected as a file: "chmod
      o-r .my.cnf" makes it unreadable to other users. We will check for the
      existence and protection of this file. Now check that you can log into
      mysql without a password:<code><br>
        mysql -u joe<br>
        mysql&gt;</code></p>
    <p> b. Load the R&amp;G book's tables into your mysql account by executing
      "sh dbbook_mysql.sh" on pe07. You will be prompted for your mysql username
      and database name (joe and joedb, for example). When it is done, check
      your tables by using mysql on pe07 with "show tables" and&nbsp; "select *
      from student;", etc.</p>
    <p>c. Drop the tables by using<br>
      <code>mysql -u joe -D joedb &lt; dropdb.sql</code></p>
    <p>Use "show tables" to see the result, then load the tables again. </p>
    <p>d. Make a typescript showing just "select * from boats" output. To do
      this, log into pe07, run the "script" command, then use mysql to access
      your tables and do the select, then exit from mysql and then exit again,
      which finishes the script in file "typescript". Rename typescript to
      "problem1.txt" in your hw2 directory. Although ".txt" doesn't mean
      anything to the Linux OS, it indicates a text file to most users because
      of its Windows meaning.&nbsp; If you couldn't load the database, explain
      what happened in this file, with script of error in the execution.</p>
    <p>2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign Keys.</span> R&amp;G
      Exercise 3.8&nbsp; Note that these tables are in tables/createdb.sql, and
      you can change their create-tables temporarily for experiments if you
      wish, and just reload the database afterwards. Put this answer in
      problem2.txt in your hw2 directory.&nbsp; It would be a good idea to test
      your SQL by putting your solution in a .sql file and running it, but that
      is not required for the homework. For part 6, consider the Legal
      department instead of the Toy department, since it shows up in our loaded
      data.</p>
    <p>3. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Null foreign keys</span>. Note that
      createdb.sql's dept table has a nullable managerid. Show that because of
      this, you can insert a row with a null managerid and have a department
      without a real manager, even though we have a foreign key constraint on
      managerid. Put your insert statement into insertnull.sql, and show that
      file and results on Oracle and (optionally) mysql (of select * from dept)
      in problem3.txt for Oracle and/or problem3_mysql.txt for mysql in your hw2
      directory. In practice, we prefer not null foreign key columns to avoid
      this behavior. Sometimes a null FK is appropriate, in the case that the
      referenced information is optional or not available yet when this row is
      inserted. For example, the nullable column fid in table class is explained
      by needing to plan courses ahead of time, when the teacher is not yet
      assigned.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SQL Exercises</span>: Execute on Oracle.
      Optionally, also execute them on mysql and put results in
      problem4_mysql.txt, for example. In problem 4, the lack of INTERSECT and
      EXCEPT make some queries impossible in mysql without a subquery.</p>
    <p>4.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> SQL</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">without
        subqueries. </span>Our first coverage (Lectures 4 and 5) was of queries
      we can do in SQL without using subqueries or division. Do the queries of
      Exercise 4.3, parts 1-4 and 9-11 in SQL without using subqueries (i.e.,
      your answer must have only one SELECT in it, plus one more for each UNION
      or INTERSECTION or EXCEPT/MINUS in use. There are some SQL answers in the
      online solutions, but most have subqueries.&nbsp; Create a script
      problem4.sql with these queries, in order. <a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/cs630/problem4.sql">problem4.sql
        </a>is supplied with the first problem solved. Follow the directions in
      that script, and provide the output in problem4.txt. You can copy
      problem4.sql to your current directory on cs.umb.edu by "<code>cp
        /htdocs/cs630/problem4.sql .</code>"</p>
    <p>Note that problem 8 has queries that don't need subqueries, on the Yelp
      database, so you may want to do that one next.</p>
    <p>5.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> SQL with subqueries</span> if
      desired. Do the queries of Exercise 5.2, parts 1, 4, 5 and 7 in SQL and
      create a script problem5.sql (following the pattern of problem4.sql) and
      its output in problem5.txt, and optionally in problem5_mysql.txt. For
      problem 11, output the sname as well as the pname and cost.</p>
    <p>6. <span style="font-weight: bold;">SQL with group by, having</span>.
      Create a script problem6.sql (following the pattern of problem4.sql) and
      its output in problem6.txt/problem6_mysql.txt. Use the schema of Exercise
      5-1 (but change student's <code>level </code>to <code> standing </code>to
      match our <code>createdb.sql</code>) to do these:</p>
    <p>a. Find the major and the average age of students for that major, for
      each major. List major and average age.</p>
    <p>b. For each room that has a class, find how many different departments
      use that room for classes.List room and count of departments. Use the
      class's faculty's deptid as the department using a room. Don't report null
      room values.</p>
    <p>c. Display results from b. only for rooms used by 2 or more departments.</p>
    <p>7. <span style="font-weight: bold;">SQL with more advanced features if
        needed.</span> Do the queries of Exercise 5.4 after adding <code>dname
      </code>to <code>Dept </code>in the schema (it is this way in
      createdb.sql). Do parts 1, 3 and 6 in SQL and create a script problem7.sql
      (following the pattern of problem4.sql) and its output in problem7.txt.</p>

      <b>Oracle vs. mysql using a larger DB. </b>The mysql answers are optional
      for CS430, but I hope you'll be interested in seeing how well mysql works
      in a fairly realistic setting. If you haven't read Yelp reviews before,
      visit for example <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-of-massachusetts-boston-dorchester">Yelp
        on UMB</a><span style="color: black;"> </span>or <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=restaurants&amp;find_loc=Dorchester%2C+Boston%2C+MA">Yelp
        on Dorchester restaurants.</a><b><br>
      </b></p>

      <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset">partial Yelp database</a> (as of
      this spring) is now publicly available in database yelp_db in both our
      Oracle and mysql servers. This database is available online, ready for
      loading into mysql. </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">This
      paragraph just explains why some reviews are missing in the Oracle version
      of the database: you don't need to do anything about it, just do SQL
      queries on what's there. To move the tables to Oracle, I first used mysql
      to dump them to CSV files (CSV stands for comma-separated values). Most
      tables were easily loaded using sqlldr from these CSV files. However, the
      review table is full of entries with newlines (the actual reviews), and
      Oracle's sqlldr insists on treating newlines as ends of records. So I
      wrote a mysql query to use string REPLACE on the review text to change
      newlines to spaces, and output values in CSV format. This worked except
      for a few rows, which still failed, so we have 0.3% fewer reviews in
      Oracle.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">a.
      First find out basic facts on this database. The core tables are <code>review</code>,
      holding reviews by users about businesses, <code>yuser </code>for the
      users, and <code>business </code>for the businesses. We can't use "user"
      as a table name because it's a reserved word in Oracle. Use "describe" on
      these tables in both mysql and Oracle and include the output in your
      paper. You can access yuser, for example, as table yelp_db.yuser in either
      DB. Note that datatype "int(11)" for mysql is really just int, the
      standard type. Note any non-standard types.&nbsp; For a list of SQL
      standard types, see <a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/cs630/slides/Lecture03.pdf">Lecture 3 slides</a>.
      Find out how many rows each of these three tables have using SQL. Put this
      output in problem8intro.txt.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">b.
      Let's compare Oracle and mysql for this sizable database. Run each query
      twice. CS630 students should time the queries. timing. Mysql shows
      execution time after each query automatically. For Oracle, use "set timing
      on" for a session. Although Oracle is using a multiple disks and mysql
      only one disk, they both have enough memory for the entire yelp_db
      database, so a second execution of a query should involve no disk reading,
      usually the most time-consuming part of a query on a large database.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Queries
      on yelp_db: Treat these as described in problem4.sql, plus "set timing on"
      for CS630 students (optional for CS430) and put the queries in
      problem8.sql and the output in file problem8.txt. CS630 students should
      summarize the findings on relative performance of the two systems at the
      end of the problem8.txt file (one full sentence is fine.) </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">i.
      Find the maximum cool count in the reviews. You can use this value to find
      the max-cool review(s) themselves, but don't show this in the output file
      (too much output). Find the number of reviews containing the word 'dirty',
      and separately, containing the word 'clean'.</p>

      Find the number of users (#unique user ids) reviewing businesses in 'NV'.</p>

      Find the number of users with cool count over 10 reviewing businesses in
      'NV'. Note that both reviews and users have cool counts. A user's cool
      count gets incremented when one of their reviews is marked "cool".</p>

      Use "show create table yelp_db.review" in mysql to see the create table
      statement used for this table. This information can be extracted from
      Oracle as well but it's somewhat harder: see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18264584/show-create-table-equivalent-in-oracle-sql">StackOverflow
        answer</a> if interested. Use this report from mysql to determine the
      foreign keys in use here. Put this output and discussion in
      problem8FKs.txt.</p>
